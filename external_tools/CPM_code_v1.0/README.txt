Path Information
----------------
To add the CPM Toolbox to your path, do something like the following
(make sure to specify the FULL path structure)

>> addpath(genpath('/w/233/jenn/CPM/CPM_code/'));


Also, don't forget to add the data directory to your path if you plan
to use the demos and demo data.

>> addpath('/w/233/jenn/CPM/CPM_DATA/');


Demo Information
-----------------
To run the demos, go into the demo directory and select the demo you want.
Demos can be run by typing their name in to the command line -- however,
they are more instructive if the comments surrounding the code are read
in conjunction with execution of the code.

For the EM-CPM, I recommend looking first at EMCPM_singleClass_demo.m.
This should take around 15 minutes to run to completion.
